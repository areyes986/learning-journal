# How Computers Work #

**what makes a computer?**

1. take input
    - things that we do to computer
1. store info
    - info is that is stored in memory
1. process it
    - takes info manipulates using algorithm sends info back to memory
1. output results
    - depends on what comp is designed to do.

computers started out of calculators

**how is info represented?**

-bit, smallest bit of info you can store
*binary number system* only zero and one, any number can be represented

*text in binary* 
text can be represented as numbers which is then represented into binary

*images in binary*
made of pixels, each pixel has a color and each color is represented with numbers

*sound in binary*
Every sound is a series of vibrations and can be represented graphiaclly as a wave form. Points on wave form can be represented as numbers

**circuits** combine and modify input and output signals
- smaller computers are faster being the smaller the curcuit is, the less distance the electric signal has to go

**4 parts of computer**
1. Input - converts physical input to binary info (keyboard,camera,gps)
1. Memory - stores info (input sent as binary)
1. CPU - central processing unit calculates info (requests instructions and runs instructs and stores results in memory)
1. Output converts info into physical output (reponse from device)

**How do hardware and software come together**

- *CPU* - masterchip that control all other parts of the computer
    - it knows which circuits to use and when to use them
- software tells CPU what to do

*operating system* - master program that uses manages how software uses hardwat of computer 
- has abilities to control other software on computers

# Programming with JavaScript #

1. Define the goal
1. Design the script - to design a script, you need to split the goal into a series of tasks. Than write down steps that the comp needs to perform to complete task.
1. Code each step in JavaScript


# Expressions and Operators #

**Expression** 
evaluates into a single value. There are two types of expression.

*Assign a value to a variable*
- variable needs to be assigned a value. It can be done using the assignment operator (=). 

`var color = 'beige';`

*Use two or more values to return a single value.*
- you can perform operations on any number of indiv. values to get a single value,

**Operators**
expressions rely on operators, they allow to create a single value from one or more value.


`var area = 3 * 2;`


# Functions # 
lets you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you use a *functions*.
kind of like *instinct* so you do not have to keep giving instuctions for same thing. 

*calling* is when you ask a function to perform a task. 

*parameters* are pieces of info passed to a function. 

*return value* is when you write a function and expect it to give you an answer.

**Declaring a Function** 

*function declaration*
you give it a name then write the statements needed to achieve task inside curly braces. 

```
function sayHello() {
    document.write('Hello!);
}
```

*Calling a Function*
after declaration, you can execute all the statments between the curly braces with just one line of code.
